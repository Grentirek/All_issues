This issue sometimes occurs in our own .git terminals or cmd terminals when we need to remove a folder.
And really, i couldn't find the solution for "windows" on the internet. For that, i had to found the solution for this myself.
The solution is very easy and a my old tactic. Restart your computer and quickly manually remove that folder. 
You can delete it without the computer realizing that that folder has links on the internet or elsewhere.

I hope this helped you.
